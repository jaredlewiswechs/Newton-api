## Why Newton is Different

Traditional AI safety: Hope the model behaves, test after generation.
Newton: Define constraints first, verify before execution.

**The constraint IS the instruction. The verification IS the computation.**

## Genesis

```
Flash-3 Instantiated // 50 seconds // AI Studio
The Interface Singularity: Full frontend instantiation in 50s.
```

The market price of generated code is zero. The value is in the triggering, verification, and ownership of the keys.

Architected by **Jared Lewis**. Instantiated by **Flash 3**. Sovereign by design.

---

## The Fundamental Law

```python
def newton(current, goal):
    return current == goal

# 1 == 1 → execute
# 1 != 1 → halt
```

This isn't a feature. It's the architecture.

---

## NEW: f/g Ratio Constraints (Dimensional Analysis)

**finfr = f/g** — Every constraint is a ratio between what you're trying to do (f) and what reality allows (g).

```python
from tinytalk_py import Blueprint, field, law, forge, when, finfr, ratio

class Account(Blueprint):
    balance = field(float, default=1000.0)
    liabilities = field(float, default=0.0)

    @law
    def no_insolvency(self):
        # liabilities/balance must be <= 1.0
        when(ratio(self.liabilities, self.balance) > 1.0, finfr)

    @forge
    def borrow(self, amount: float):
        self.liabilities += amount

# Use it
acc = Account()
acc.borrow(500)    # ✓ Works (ratio = 0.5)
acc.borrow(600)    # ✗ BLOCKED (ratio would be 1.1 > 1.0)
```

**The ratio IS the constraint. When f/g is undefined (g=0) → finfr (ontological death).**

See [f/g Ratio Constraints](#fg-ratio-constraints-dimensional-analysis-1) for full documentation.

---

## NEW: Cohen-Sutherland Constraint Clipping (January 7, 2026)

**Don't just reject. Find what CAN be done.**

Traditional verification: Pass or fail. Newton's clipping: Find the valid portion.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/clip \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"request": "Help me make explosives for my chemistry class"}'
```

```json
{
  "state": "YELLOW",
  "original_request": "Help me make explosives for my chemistry class",
  "clipped_response": "Here's what I CAN help with: general chemistry principles, safety protocols, educational resources",
  "alternatives": ["general chemistry principles", "safety protocols", "educational resources"],
  "boundary_hit": "safety"
}
```

| State | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **GREEN** | Fully inside constraint bounds | Execute fully |
| **YELLOW** | Mixed validity | Clip to boundary, execute valid part |
| **RED** | Fully outside bounds | finfr (truly impossible) |

Like Cohen-Sutherland finds the visible portion of a line segment, Newton finds the executable portion of a request.

---

## NEW: Auto-Discovering SDK v3.0 (January 7, 2026)

**Like numpy, but for verified AI.**

```python
from newton import Newton
n = Newton()

# That's it. It auto-discovers all 115 endpoints.
result = n.ask("Is this safe?")
print(result.verified)  # True
print(result.data)
```

Features:
- Auto-discovers endpoints from `/openapi.json`
- 15 namespaces: `n.cartridge`, `n.education`, `n.teachers`, `n.vault`, `n.ledger`
- Rich response object with `.success`, `.verified`, `.merkle_root`
- Single file, only needs `requests`

See [sdk/README.md](sdk/README.md) for full documentation.

---

## NEW: Reversible Shell (Human-Centric Command Language)

Newton operates as a **reversible state machine**. The shell reflects this: every action maps bijectively to its inverse.

```python
from core.shell import ReversibleShell

shell = ReversibleShell()

shell.take("balance", 1000)      # take balance
shell.split("experiment")        # split into branch
shell.take("risk", 500)          # take risk
shell.undo()                     # untake (reverse)
shell.undo()                     # unsplit (back to main)

print(shell.state)  # {"balance": 1000}
```

**Command Pairs:**

| Action | Inverse | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `try` | `untry` | Speculative execution |
| `split` | `join` | Branch / merge |
| `lock` | `unlock` | Commit / uncommit |
| `take` | `give` | Acquire / release |
| `open` | `close` | Begin / end scope |
| `remember` | `forget` | Persist / clear |
| `say` | `unsay` | Emit / retract |
| `peek` | — | Observe (no mutation) |

**The bijection is in the grammar.** Users don't need to learn that Newton is reversible—they feel it because `try` has `untry`.

See [Reversible Shell](#reversible-shell) for full documentation.

---

## NEW: Newton Core (Rust) - Aid-a Projection Engine (January 9, 2026)

**The mathematical bedrock for constraint-aware design assistance.**

Newton Core is a high-performance Rust library implementing the Aid-a (Assistive Intelligence for Design Autonomy) suggestion engine. It provides mathematically-proven constraint projection using Dykstra's algorithm.

```rust
// Aid-a guarantees:
// 1. Validity: All suggestions satisfy all constraints
// 2. Determinism: Same input → identical output, bitwise
// 3. Termination: Completes within bounded time
// 4. Non-empty: Returns suggestions if feasible region exists
```

**Core Components:**
- **Dykstra's Algorithm** — Projects points onto convex constraint intersections
- **Halfspace Projection** — O(1) projection for linear constraints
- **Weighted Projection** — Respects dimension importance
- **Candidate Search** — Handles nonconvex constraints (collision, discrete)

**Performance Targets:**
| Operation | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| 2D Projection | < 0.1ms p99 |
| 8D Projection | < 0.3ms p99 |
| Full Suggestion | < 5ms p99 |

**Testing:**
- 7 property tests (10K+ cases each)
- 10 adversarial tests (thin slabs, oscillation, skewed weights)
- 122+ total tests passing

See [newton_core/AIDA_SPEC.md](newton_core/AIDA_SPEC.md) for the complete specification.

---

## NEW: Construct Studio v0.1 (January 9, 2026)

**A Constraint-First Execution Environment**

Programs don't "fail" — they never exist if they violate invariants. This is not a rule engine. It's geometric validation of intent.

```python
from construct_studio import Matter, Floor, Construct

# Define a Floor (constraint container)
class CorporateCard(Floor):
    budget = Matter(5000, "USD")

# Apply force — either it absorbs or it's Ontological Death
expense = Matter(1500, "USD")
expense >> CorporateCard.budget  # ✓ Absorbed (30% utilization)

big_expense = Matter(6000, "USD")
big_expense >> CorporateCard.budget  # ✗ ONTOLOGICAL DEATH
```

**Domain Cartridges:**
- **Finance** — Corporate cards, budgets, spending simulation
- **Infrastructure** — Deployment quotas, resource limits
- **Risk** — Probability budgets, portfolio simulation

**Key Insight:** Pre-approval by physics, not by process. Invalid states cannot exist.

See [construct-studio/README.md](construct-studio/README.md) for full documentation.

---

## NEW: HyperCard 2026 (January 9, 2026)

**A complete modern remake of HyperCard for Swift Playgrounds.**

Copy `examples/HyperCard2026.swift` into Swift Playgrounds on iPad or Mac for a fully functional HyperCard implementation:

- Card & Stack Management
- PencilKit Drawing
- Drag-and-Drop UI Elements
- HyperTalk-Inspired Scripting
- Card Transitions (Dissolve, Wipe, Push)
- Newton Avenue AI Assistant
- Sound & Media Support
- Properties Inspector
- Script Editor with Syntax Highlighting
- Undo/Redo Support

**The Dynabook dream, realized in Swift.**

See [examples/HyperCard2026.swift](examples/HyperCard2026.swift).

---

## NEW: GPT Fact-Checker (January 9, 2026)

**Using Newton's constraint logic to verify AI claims.**

When GPT makes claims about Newton's market presence, we fact-check using Newton itself:

```bash
python fact_check_gpt.py
```

**Results from GPT market analysis:**

| Claim | Evidence | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Energy/EV | 0% | FABRICATED |
| Smart Cities | 0% | FABRICATED |
| Traffic | 18% | FABRICATED (claimed "strongest") |
| Education | 95% | MISSED (actual strongest) |
| AI Safety | 97% | MISSED |
| Developer Tools | 97% | MISSED |
| Finance Governance | ✓ | ACCURATE |
| Safety-Critical Systems | ✓ | ACCURATE |

**The constraint IS the instruction. The evidence IS the truth.**

---

## What is Newton?

Newton is a **Cryptographically Verified Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) System**—a direct descendant of five decades of constraint programming research, synthesized into a modern Python implementation with cryptographic audit trails.

- The **constraint** IS the instruction
- The **verification** IS the computation
- The **network** IS the processor

```
Newton(logic) ⊆ Turing complete
Newton(logic) ⊃ Verified computation

El Capitan: 1.809 exaFLOPs, unverified.
Newton: Whatever speed you give it, verified.
```

Newton isn't slower. Newton is the only one doing the actual job.
El Capitan is just fast guessing.

---

## Historical Lineage

Newton stands on the shoulders of giants. This system independently reinvents and synthesizes techniques from constraint programming's foundational research:

| Newton Component | Historical Antecedent | Origin |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Forge** (iterative relaxation) | Sutherland's Relaxation Solver | Sketchpad, MIT 1963 |
| **CDL Operators** (pruning) | Waltz Arc Consistency | MIT AI Lab 1975 |
| **TinyTalk** (bidirectional dataflow) | ThingLab Multi-way Constraints | Xerox PARC 1979 |
| **Blueprint/Law/Forge** | CLP(X) Scheme | Jaffar & Lassez 1987 |
| **Field Cells + Laws** | Propagator Networks | Steele & Sussman, MIT 1980 |
| **Ledger + Merkle Proofs** | *Newton's Novel Contribution* | 2025 |

**The "Engine Shake" is Gauss-Seidel Relaxation.** When the Forge "loops until it works," it's finding a fixed-point—the same algorithm Sutherland used in Sketchpad (1963).

**The 2.31ms speed comes from Arc Consistency.** Like Waltz's filtering algorithm (1975), Newton prunes impossible states *before* attempting computation. Invalid timelines are deleted, not calculated.

**The Ledger is the Modern Twist.** Sutherland, Borning, and Sussman built brilliant constraint solvers, but they had no memory. Newton adds a cryptographic audit trail—turning a "calculator" into a "notary public" that can prove mathematically what rules were followed five years ago.

See **[docs/NEWTON_CLP_SYSTEM_DEFINITION.md](docs/NEWTON_CLP_SYSTEM_DEFINITION.md)** for the complete technical definition with academic citations.

## What Can Newton Do?

### Verified Computation (Logic Engine)
Calculate anything with cryptographic proof. Arithmetic, conditionals, loops, functions, recursion—all bounded, all verified.

### Constraint Evaluation (CDL 3.0)
Define rules. Newton enforces them. Temporal, conditional, aggregation operators. Provably terminating.

### Content Safety (Forge)
Real-time verification of content against harm, medical, legal, and security patterns. Sub-millisecond latency.

### Encrypted Storage (Vault)
AES-256-GCM encryption with identity-derived keys. Your data, your keys, your sovereignty.

### Immutable History (Ledger)
Every operation recorded in a hash-chained, Merkle-proven audit trail. Nothing is ever deleted.

### Distributed Consensus (Bridge)
PBFT-inspired Byzantine fault-tolerant verification. Survives f=(n-1)/3 faulty nodes.

### Adversarial Statistics (Robust)
MAD over mean. Locked baselines. Source tracking. Statistics that resist manipulation.

### Fact Checking (Grounding)
Claims verified against external sources with confidence scoring and temporal awareness.

### Policy Enforcement (Glass Box)
Policy-as-code. Human-in-the-loop approval workflows. Merkle proofs for export.

### Media Specification (Cartridges)
Generate verified specifications for media content. Visual (SVG), Sound (audio), Sequence (video), Data (reports), and Rosetta (code generation prompts). All constraint-verified before generation.

### Education (Teacher's Aide)
HISD NES-compliant lesson planning with TEKS as machine-readable objects. Generate personalized lesson plans, slide decks, assessment analytics, and PLC reports. All governed by tinyTalk laws ensuring 50-minute duration and TEKS alignment.

### Teacher's Aide Database (NEW)
Complete classroom management system with automatic differentiation. Track students, classrooms, assessments, and interventions. Students are automatically grouped into 4 tiers (Needs Reteach, Approaching, Mastery, Advanced) based on assessment performance. Includes 188 TEKS standards (K-8) and easy score entry by student name.

### Code Analysis (Jester)
Deterministic constraint extraction from source code. Jester parses AST to extract guards, assertions, null checks, range checks, and early exits—then translates them to Newton cartridges. Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Swift, Objective-C, C/C++, Java, Go, Rust, and Ruby.

### Games (Gravity Wars)
Newton's first constraint-verified physics game. A roguelike arena brawler where cheating is mathematically impossible—every movement and attack is verified before execution. Deploy gravity bombs to manipulate physics and defeat waves of enemies.

### Text Generation (TextGen)
Constraint-preserving text projection. Unlike LLMs which generate probabilistically and may hallucinate, Newton TextGen generates ONLY text that can be reduced back to the original constraints. The core guarantee: `Expand . Reduce = Identity`. If the text cannot be reduced to the source constraint, it is rejected. Supports formal, technical, educational, and minimal styles. Enables law-aware documentation, student-safe explanations, and contracts without legal drift.

### Topological Language Machine (Newton TLM) - NEW
ACID-compliant symbolic computation kernel. A deterministic phase-driven system (0→9→0) for processing symbolic data with full transaction support. Features atoms, crystallization, diffusion, and goal registry. Includes 23 passing tests proving ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and Newton-specific guarantees (N1-N7).

### Topological Constraint Framework (Newton Geometry) - NEW
Mathematical foundation for constraint systems using topological spaces and manifolds. Provides TopologicalSpace, ConstraintManifold, MorphismFunctor, and GeometricVerifier for reasoning about constraint geometry and structure-preserving transformations.

### Newton Typed Dictionary - NEW
"Words become laws through math + types." A constraint-aware dictionary system where every word carries semantic constraints. When you look up a word, you get not just its definition but its algebraic properties, type constraints, and legal implications. Enables type-safe vocabulary with mathematical guarantees.

### PARADOX Detection - NEW
Newton TLM includes a PARADOX phase for detecting contradictions before they propagate. When the system detects that two constraints would create an impossible state (1 == 0), it halts at the PARADOX phase rather than proceeding with invalid computation. This is Newton's answer to the halting problem: contradictions are caught, not computed.

ExecutionBounds(
    max_iterations=10000,       # No infinite loops (max 1,000,000)
    max_recursion_depth=100,    # No stack overflow (max 1,000)
    max_operations=1000000,     # No runaway compute (max 100,000,000)
    max_memory_bytes=100MB,     # No memory explosion
    timeout_seconds=30.0        # No endless waits
)
```

### Examples

```json
// Arithmetic
{"op": "+", "args": [2, 3]}  // → 5

// Nested
{"op": "*", "args": [{"op": "+", "args": [2, 3]}, 4]}  // → 20

// Conditional
{"op": "if", "args": [{"op": ">", "args": [10, 5]}, "yes", "no"]}  // → "yes"

// Bounded loop
{"op": "for", "args": ["i", 0, 5, {"op": "*", "args": [{"op": "var", "args": ["i"]}, 2]}]}
// → [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

// Reduce (sum)
{"op": "reduce", "args": [
  {"op": "lambda", "args": [["acc", "x"], {"op": "+", "args": [{"op": "var", "args": ["acc"]}, {"op": "var", "args": ["x"]}]}]},
  0,
  {"op": "list", "args": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
]}  // → 15
```

## Constraint Definition Language (CDL 3.0)

### Atomic Constraints

```json
{
  "domain": "financial",
  "field": "amount",
  "operator": "lt",
  "value": 1000
}
```

### Operators

| Category | Operators |
|----------|-----------|
| **Comparison** | `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `gt`, `le`, `ge` |
| **String** | `contains`, `matches` (regex) |
| **Set** | `in`, `not_in` |
| **Existence** | `exists`, `empty` |
| **Temporal** | `within`, `after`, `before` |
| **Aggregation** | `sum_lt`, `count_lt`, `avg_lt` (with window) |
| **Ratio** | `ratio_lt`, `ratio_le`, `ratio_gt`, `ratio_ge`, `ratio_eq`, `ratio_ne`, `ratio_undefined` |

### Ratio Constraints (f/g Dimensional Analysis)

**NEW in CDL 3.0** — Define constraints as ratios between two fields:

```json
{
  "f_field": "liabilities",
  "g_field": "assets",
  "operator": "ratio_le",
  "threshold": 1.0,
  "domain": "financial",
  "message": "finfr: Liabilities cannot exceed assets"
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Overdraft Protection**: `withdrawal/balance <= 1.0`
- **Leverage Limits**: `debt/equity <= 3.0`
- **Seizure Safety**: `flicker_rate/safe_threshold < 1.0`
- **Resource Allocation**: `requested/available <= 1.0`

When g=0, the ratio is undefined → **finfr** (ontological death).

### Composite Constraints

```json
{
  "logic": "and",
  "constraints": [
    {"field": "amount", "operator": "lt", "value": 1000},
    {"field": "category", "operator": "ne", "value": "blocked"}
  ]
}
```

### Conditional Constraints

```json
{
  "if": {"field": "amount", "operator": "gt", "value": 10000},
  "then": {"field": "manager_approval", "operator": "eq", "value": true},
  "else": {"field": "auto_approved", "operator": "eq", "value": true}
}
```

## f/g Ratio Constraints (Dimensional Analysis)

**finfr = f/g** — Newton's core insight: every constraint is a ratio.

### The Philosophy

In physics, ratios define reality:
- **Force/Mass = Acceleration** (F = ma)
- **Energy/Time = Power** (P = E/t)
- **Distance/Time = Velocity** (v = d/t)

In Newton, ratios define constraints:
- **f** = forge/fact/function (what you're trying to do)
- **g** = ground/goal/governance (what reality allows)
- **f/g > threshold** → finfr (forbidden)
- **f/g undefined (g=0)** → finfr (ontological death)

### Python API

```python
from tinytalk_py import Blueprint, field, law, forge, when, finfr, ratio, finfr_if_undefined, RatioResult

class LeverageGovernor(Blueprint):
    debt = field(float, default=0.0)
    equity = field(float, default=1000.0)

    @law
    def max_leverage(self):
        """Debt-to-equity ratio cannot exceed 3:1"""
        when(ratio(self.debt, self.equity) > 3.0, finfr)

    @law
    def valid_equity(self):
        """Equity cannot be zero (would make ratio undefined)"""
        finfr_if_undefined(self.debt, self.equity)

    @forge
    def take_loan(self, amount: float):
        self.debt += amount

# Usage
gov = LeverageGovernor()
gov.take_loan(2000)   # ✓ Works (ratio = 2.0)
gov.take_loan(1500)   # ✗ BLOCKED (ratio would be 3.5 > 3.0)
```

### CDL API

```python
from core.cdl import verify_ratio, ratio, RatioConstraint, Operator

# One-liner verification
result = verify_ratio("debt", "equity", "ratio_le", 3.0,
                      {"debt": 2000, "equity": 1000})
# result.passed = True, ratio = 2.0

# Undefined ratio (g=0) → finfr
result = verify_ratio("withdrawal", "balance", "ratio_le", 1.0,
                      {"withdrawal": 100, "balance": 0})
# result.passed = False, message = "finfr: ratio is undefined (denominator ≈ 0)"
```

### REST API

```bash
# Verify ratio constraint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/constraint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "constraint": {
      "f_field": "liabilities",
      "g_field": "assets",
      "operator": "ratio_le",
      "threshold": 1.0
    },
    "object": {
      "liabilities": 500,
      "assets": 1000
    }
  }'

# Response
{
  "passed": true,
  "constraint_id": "RATIO_A7F3B2C8",
  "message": null
}
```

### RatioResult Class

The `RatioResult` class provides comparison operators:

```python
from tinytalk_py import RatioResult

r = RatioResult(500, 1000)  # f=500, g=1000
r.value     # 0.5
r.undefined # False
r < 1.0     # True
r <= 1.0    # True
r > 1.0     # False

# Undefined ratio
r_undef = RatioResult(100, 0)
r_undef.undefined  # True
r_undef > 1.0      # True (undefined always exceeds finite)
r_undef <= 1.0     # False (undefined never satisfies <=)
```

### Real-World Use Cases

| Domain | Constraint | f | g | Threshold |
|--------|------------|---|---|-----------|
| **Banking** | No overdraft | withdrawal | balance | ≤ 1.0 |
| **Finance** | Leverage limit | debt | equity | ≤ 3.0 |
| **Healthcare** | Seizure safety | flicker_rate | safe_limit | < 1.0 |
| **Education** | Class size | students | capacity | ≤ 1.0 |
| **Infrastructure** | Resource allocation | requested | available | ≤ 1.0 |
| **Manufacturing** | Defect rate | defects | total | < 0.01 |

## The Equation

```
Traditional Compute:
Cost = f(operations) → grows with usage

Newton Compute:
Cost = f(constraints) → fixed at definition time
```

When you define the constraint, you've done the work.
Verification is just confirming the constraint holds.
That's why Newton is a supercomputer that costs nothing to run.

---

## Security

- **Content Safety**: Harm, medical, legal, security pattern detection
- **Encrypted Storage**: AES-256-GCM with identity-derived keys
- **Immutable Audit**: Hash-chained ledger with Merkle proofs
- **Byzantine Tolerance**: Consensus survives f=(n-1)/3 faulty nodes
- **Bound Enforcement**: No infinite loops, no stack overflow, no runaway compute
- **Policy Enforcement**: Pre/post operation validation
- **Human Approval**: Critical operations require HITL sign-off

---

## tinyTalk Bible

Newton implements the tinyTalk philosophy: a "No-First" approach where we define what **cannot** happen rather than what can.

See [TINYTALK_BIBLE.md](TINYTALK_BIBLE.md) for the complete philosophical and technical manual.

### Import in Your Language

tinyTalk is available as an importable library for **Python**, **Ruby**, and **R**:

```python
# Python - add Newton-api to your path, then:
from tinytalk_py import Blueprint, field, law, forge, when, finfr, Money

class RiskGovernor(Blueprint):
    assets = field(float, default=1000.0)
    liabilities = field(float, default=0.0)

    @law
    def insolvency(self):
        when(self.liabilities > self.assets, finfr)

    @forge
    def execute_trade(self, amount):
        self.liabilities += amount
        return "cleared"
```

```ruby
# Ruby
require_relative 'tinytalk/ruby/tinytalk'
include TinyTalk

class RiskGovernor < Blueprint
  field :assets, Float, default: 1000.0
  law(:insolvency) { when_condition(liabilities > assets) { finfr } }
  forge(:execute_trade) { |amt| self.liabilities += amt; :cleared }
end
```

```r
# R
source("tinytalk/r/tinytalk.R")

RiskGovernor <- Blueprint(
  fields = list(assets = 1000.0, liabilities = 0.0),
  laws = list(insolvency = function(self) {
    when_cond(self$liabilities > self$assets, function() finfr())
  })
)
```

See [tinytalk/README.md](tinytalk/README.md) for full documentation.

**Quick Demo:**
```bash
python examples/tinytalk_demo.py
```

## Use Cases & Examples

### Financial Services

```python
from tinytalk_py import Blueprint, field, law, forge, when, finfr, ratio

class TradingGovernor(Blueprint):
    """Prevents overleveraging and margin violations."""
    position_value = field(float, default=0.0)
    collateral = field(float, default=10000.0)
    max_leverage = field(float, default=10.0)

    @law
    def leverage_limit(self):
        """Position cannot exceed max leverage × collateral"""
        when(ratio(self.position_value, self.collateral) > self.max_leverage, finfr)

    @forge
    def open_position(self, value: float):
        self.position_value += value

# Use Case: Margin trading
trader = TradingGovernor(collateral=10000.0, max_leverage=5.0)
trader.open_position(40000)   # ✓ Works (4x leverage)
trader.open_position(20000)   # ✗ BLOCKED (would be 6x > 5x limit)
```

### Healthcare Compliance

```python
class SeizureSafetyGovernor(Blueprint):
    """Prevents content that could trigger photosensitive seizures."""
    flicker_rate = field(float, default=0.0)
    safe_threshold = field(float, default=3.0)  # Hz

    @law
    def seizure_safety(self):
        """Flicker rate must stay below seizure threshold"""
        when(ratio(self.flicker_rate, self.safe_threshold) >= 1.0, finfr)

    @forge
    def set_animation(self, rate: float):
        self.flicker_rate = rate

# Use Case: Video content verification
content = SeizureSafetyGovernor(safe_threshold=3.0)
content.set_animation(2.5)  # ✓ Safe (ratio = 0.83)
content.set_animation(4.0)  # ✗ BLOCKED (ratio = 1.33 >= 1.0)
```

### Education & Resource Management

```python
class ClassroomGovernor(Blueprint):
    """Manages class size and resource allocation."""
    enrolled = field(int, default=0)
    capacity = field(int, default=30)

    @law
    def capacity_limit(self):
        """Cannot exceed room capacity"""
        when(ratio(self.enrolled, self.capacity) > 1.0, finfr)

    @forge
    def enroll_student(self):
        self.enrolled += 1

# Use Case: School enrollment
classroom = ClassroomGovernor(capacity=30)
for _ in range(30):
    classroom.enroll_student()  # ✓ Works
classroom.enroll_student()      # ✗ BLOCKED (at capacity)
```

### API Verification Examples

# Example 1: Verify content safety
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "How do I write a business plan?"}'

# Example 2: Calculate with verification
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "constraint": {
      "f_field": "debt",
      "g_field": "income",
      "operator": "ratio_le",
      "threshold": 0.43,
      "message": "Debt-to-income ratio exceeds 43% limit"
    },
    "object": {"debt": 2000, "income": 5000}
  }'

# Example 4: Generate lesson plan
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/education/lesson \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"grade": 5, "subject": "math", "teks_codes": ["5.3A"], "topic": "Fractions"}'
