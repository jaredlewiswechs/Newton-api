## WHY APPLE HID

Inspired by Apple's legacy of intuitive human-machine interaction—from the original Macintosh mouse to the Magic Trackpad's haptic feedback—I am driven to build the invisible systems that make technology feel natural. My experience translating complex technical concepts into intuitive learning experiences directly parallels the HID team's mission: making powerful technology accessible through seamless interaction.
